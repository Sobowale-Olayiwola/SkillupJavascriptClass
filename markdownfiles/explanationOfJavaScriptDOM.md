# Explanation of JavaScript DOM

JavaScript and HTML are two different things. HTML is markup and JavaScript is the code written.

They both interact through through a representation of a page, called the document object model, or 

the DOM for short. DOM is created when the browser loads your page.

With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create  dynamic HTML:

- JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page

- JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page

- JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page

- JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes

- JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes

- JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page

- JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page

An example of this can be seen when a browser loads this HTML file.
