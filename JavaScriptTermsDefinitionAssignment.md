# Explain JavaScript statements with examples

JavaScript statements are the commands to tell the browser to what action to perform. Statements are separated by semicolon (;)

and it is optional but semicolon are considered best practice. 

JavaScript statement constitutes the JavaScript code which is translated by the browser line by line and they mostly follow

an appropriate syntax. JavaScript statements are mostly composed of: Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

Examples are:

let x, y, z; //declaration of three variable

# Explain JavaScript expressions with examples

An expression in JavaScript produces a value and can be written wherever a value is expected, or it can be any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

Every syntactically valid expression resolves to some value but conceptually, there are two types of expressions: with side effects (for example: those that assign value to a variable)

and those that in some sense evaluate and therefore resolve to a value. For example as an argument in a function call or more examples we have;

my ,3 + x , myfunc("a", "b")

# What is the difference between statements/expressions?

* Statements do not produce values but expressions produce values

* Expressions are statements but Statements are not

# Explain JavaScript functions in your own words

JavaScript functions are basic unit of a program packaged within a code block to perform a single task and can be reused anywhere else in the program

by calling using its name or a reference variable. The name of a function must depict the meaning of the function it must not bring

confusion but clarity about what it does.
